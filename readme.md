# bgs-cs-comm

This is an experimental project to see if i can figure out how extensions work in browsers, in this case firefox. BGS stands for Background Script and CS stands for Content Scripts. These two are components of the extension ecosystem and work together to form part of an extension.

# Install

1. Clone the repository
2. In Firefox, go to `about:debugging`
3. Select "This Firefox" in the sidebar
4. Select "Load Temporary Add-on..."
5. Go to where you clone the repo
6. Open any file

 ## Grant Permissions

This thing needs access to all websites

 1. Navigate to `about:addons`
 2. Select the extension (I think it's called `bg-test`)
 3. Select the Permissions tab
 4. Activate the toggle for "Access your data for all website"

# Configuring

Right now the only configuration available is deciding what websites you can block.


# Coming up

- Configurable times
- Add indicator to show items being removed from blocklist
